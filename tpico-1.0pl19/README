TextPico 1.0

The pico interpreter by Dr Theo D'Hondt.  (tjdhondt@vub.ac.be)
User interfaces by Dirk van Deun.  (dvandeun@vub.ac.be)

This tpico version can be used in the course Interpretatie II
by Theo D'Hondt.  It is not the state-of-art version, but it
corresponds better with the current course notes.

In tpico, the arrow keys will access a command line history of
up to 500 lines, which are also saved to ~/.tpico_history.
Ctrl-C will either end a running computation, or kill the
interpreter, when there is no running computation.

There is a man page with further information on tpico.

This package includes what was once called a work-in-progress
version of wxPico, a GUI version based on wxWidgets, and
what is now simply called unmaintained, unused code.

The current pico engine cannot be run reliably on processors
that align data on 8-byte boundaries.  (Think Sun SPARC.)
