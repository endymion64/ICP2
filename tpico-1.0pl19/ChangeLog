tpico version 1.0: 
   - an adaptation of tpico version 1.1pl2, the latest interface
          with an old pico core (there never was a tpico 1.0 before)
   - made solely for educational purposes (a course of professor
          D'Hondt is based on this version of the pico core)

tpico version 1.0pl1:
   - the same bug fix as in tpico version 1.1pl3

tpico version 1.0pl2:
   - user interface etc. brought up to date from tpico-1.1pl5

tpico version 1.0pl3:
   - configure script patched not to look for curses if ncurses exists:
          including both causes conflicts in some gentoo installs
   - configure script and makefile tweaked to use -falign-functions=2
          when necessary

tpico version 1.0pl4:
   - bug fixed that was present but unnoticed since 1.0pl2
       _PICO_PRINT_ must return a value in pico 1.0, not in pico 1.1...

tpico version 1.0pl5:
   - reorganisation of the package, now includes a first version of
          wxPico, a GUI version using wxWindows
   - took _PICO_KILL_ out of handling of _DO_ESCAPE_, because this wipes
          all known variables -- but now some junk stays on the stack

tpico version 1.0pl6:
   - wxPico: whacked a bug in PicoMai.c and started using PicoShell
          also added Copy/Paste and a font selection dialog
   - made single-threaded for easier portability (OpenBSD/GTK)

tpico version 1.0pl7:
   - wxPico starts with fixed pitch fonts now, and it got a braindead
          Undo function which will have to do for now

tpico version 1.0pl8:
   - wxPico improvements (ctrl-enter for "run line" etc.) ported from
          version 2.0pl2

          _rl_enable_paren_matching()
   - small fixes to makefiles
